skeb learnings

https://skeb.jp/api/requests?role=client&status=complete&sort=date&offset=0
gives all of the requests for the current client, at 30 a page

each item has a bunch of info, starting with an ID identifying which work it is

we can request a download of an attachment with the following payload against the work

https://skeb.jp/api/requests/{$work_id}/download

payload:
```
{
    attachment_id: {$attachment_id},
    type: "original" | "converted",
}
```

we need to provide the skeb token in our initial request

as part of the request header:
```
authorization: Bearer {$token}
referer: https://skeb.jp/requests
```

our payload should be:
```
role: client
status: complete
sort: date
offset: 0
```

we'll have to go acquire the token manually through localStorage
