tag syntax:
tag = [a-zA-Z0-9_()-+]+

search syntax
search_list = item -> (" " -> item)*
item = grouped | or_list | single

single = modifiers? -> tag | date_added | price | source_type | media_type

source_type = "fan" | "official" | "commission"
media_type = "text" | "image"

price = price_op -> number
price_op = ">" | ">=" | ...

date_added = date_op -> date 
date_op = "before" | "after" | "on"

date = anything chrono can parse

modifiers = "-" 

or_list = single -> ("|" -> item)+

grouped = "(" -> search_list -> ")"


pub struct Condition {
    negate: bool,
    tests: Tests,
}

enum Tests {
    And(Vec<Condition>)
    Or(Vec<Condition>)
    Single(Test),
    
}

pub enum Test {
    Tag(Tag),
    Source(SourceType),
    Media(MediaType),
    DateAdded(DateOp, DateTime<Local>),
    Price(PriceOp, u32),
}
